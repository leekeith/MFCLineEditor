This simple application will open a .csv file with rows delimited
with a <cr> and display the data within as a line graph.

The user is then able to scroll through each data point to see its 
value or navigate directly to the index of a data point using the
GOTO button.

The user is also capable of adding values to the table using the Add
button on the righthand side of the window.

This application was developed using MS Visual Studio 2012 and utilizes
the NTGraph ActiveX control.  The binaries for this control are available
at: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3214/D-Graph-ActiveX-Control
